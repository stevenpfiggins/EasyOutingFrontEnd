# Easy Outing App
* This is only the front end application repo.
* The back end application repo created by the same team can be found <a href="https://github.com/stevenpfiggins/EasyOutingAPI">here</a>.
## Basic Overview
Using a user's selected interests and prompted location, a feed of outings will be listed that the user can see and select to see details if interested in that outing.

# Web Directions:
<p>1. Go to  https://easy-outings.herokuapp.com/home.</p>
<p>2. The non registered user will only be able to view the list of current available outings.</p> 
<p>3. After registering and logging in the user can then see links to interests and outings views.</p>
<p>4. Once at either of those views the user can then create, update, and delete data from those tables.</p>
<p>5. The home page will show outings based off of the users location and interests.</p>
